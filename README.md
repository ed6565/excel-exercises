Planes:  The provided worksheet came with a year of flight data for planes taking off from an airport.  Using functions and references, the goal was to add in the airline name, temperature, and temperature quality to the main sheet. (seen in colums U-W)

OnlineRetail:  Referencing the stock codes given, the task was to find the amount sold, revenue, and average price sold for.  The critical function to make this happen was a SUMIF, and while an average function could have been used for the average price, I simply just divided C2 by B2.

Cubs:  The Cubs exercise used functions such as VLOOKUP, ROUND, and a nested IF statement that used an OFFSET to answer questions such as "What was the win percentage of this seven year period?"

PvD/IC has two different excerises in it.  The first is a fun comparison of Pixar and DreamWorks movies.  it uses LOOKUP functions to parse the data to answer questions such as "Who had the higher average scores, who grosses more money," and a more intricate question of "What movies were considered both box office and critical successes, and what movies were total failures?" (Denoted by "hit!" or "miss"
    The IC spreadsheet was practice with investment functions such as NPER
    
 The BabyNames sheet was mostly text function practice such as PROPER, LEFT, and finding and replacing text.
